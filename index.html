                     <p>Got like 1 hour of sleep because halfway through the night at our AirBnB, 
                        we realized one of the doors had been unlocked the entire time. 
                     </p>
                        <p>We were further spooked when the host let us know that the couch is always in 
                        front of that door.

            <h1>My Approach To Productivity</h1>
         </header>
         <p>The ideas on this page are from a variety of sources. The ones that I can remember are:
            <ul>
               <li>Atomic Habits by James Clear</li>
               <li>Getting Things Done by David Allen</li>
               <li>100s of hours of YouTube/podcasts about productivity.</li>
            </ul>
         </p>
         <article>
            <section>
               <h2>Main Ideas:</h2>
               <ul>
                  <li>Systems are just as important than habits.</li>
                  <li>Anyone can and should change their habits</li>
                  <li>There are certain steps you can put into place today.</li>
               </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
               <h2>Systems</h2>
               <p>System: a set of things working together as parts of a mechanism or an 
         interconnecting network (Oxford Languages). Habits do not live in 
         isolation and you often need multiple habits working together to 
         accomplish one goal. Let's take getting in healthy shape as a goal. What 
         habits are required to accomplish that goal? You have to be adequate at time
         management, which is not a habit, but a system in itself, you have to eat the 
         right foods, do the correct amount of exercising. But are there habits that will 
         make those habits easier? Yes. What food you buy/ keep in the house is a habit that 
         will effect this goal. If we are talking about buying something, it might require 
         you to focus more on budgeting. Sleep is imperative for being in healthy shape, what 
         habits factor into that? Not being on your phone to close to bed (keep it a decent 
         distance from the bed?) Time management once again so you can get to bed on time. If 
         you have any special requirements that you need in order to sleep well, those need to
         be in place; ear plugs? face mask? cold shower? hot shower? lighting? temperature? book? </p>
   
               <p>Alright, I think you get the jist.</p>
   
               <p>So how can we be more intentional about this? I would argue that an important step 
                  is self-awareness. What do you need in order to make the right decision? What cues 
                  will make you make the bad decision? What percentage of the time will seeing a donut 
                  on the table lead you to eating that donut? If it's a relatively high percentage, 
                  maybe you need to find a better location for the donut? Perhaps on the shelves at the 
                  store?
               </p>
   
               <p>Long story short: If you just keep saying "I'm going to start eating right", but 
                  don't set up any additional helper habits that support that habit, you are 
                  significantly more likely to fail. 
               </p>
   
               <p>At this point you might be like "Jeez, this sounds like a lot of work, I'm just
                  trying to live my life." In the last section, I will explain why this is actually 
                  not as bad as it sounds.

               <h2>Change Your Habits?</h2>
               <p>In my opinion, the section above should really be inspiring to you. Because it 
                  means that your life is perhaps more in your control than you think. For example, I
                  once thought that I wasn't much of an intellectual or cognitiviely capable of much. 
                  Then I learned the habits that allowed me to use whatever cognitive capabilities
                  I have more efficiently and more productively. And now I would definitely consider myself 
                  an intellectual and thoroughly enjoy cognitive challenges. There are specific actionable steps
                  we can take to set up our systems which I

            <h2>Stages so far:</h2>
            <ul>
               <li>Lack of Proper Structure in Learning</li>
               <li>Some Structure, Lack Of Support</li>

         <section>
            <h3>Lack of Proper Structure in Learning</h3>
            <p>For me, this stage consisted of two main approaches: attempting to use programming apps like SoloLearn, 
               Mimo, Codecademy Go, and Grassopper AND/OR trying to following programming tutorials online. This stage
               lasted off and on for probably 3-5 years. Both approaches led me to quitting my latest attempt at learning 
               to code. With the apps, I either got bored or wasn't putting the pieces together because instead of doing 
               much coding, I was taking quizzes or doing fill in the blank coding. When it came to watching tutorials, I don't think
               I ever completed a single small project. I lacked the fundamental knowledge about programming languages and IDE's, 
               so, with no one to help, I gave up</p>

            <h3>Some Structure, Lack Of Support</h3>
            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">The next shift in my approach was when I committed to learning to code. I signed up for a university course. 
               This experience was so much better because it spoon fed me the coding fundamentals, while also getting several
               small coding projects under my belt. But even this approach has its issues. But fear not. The last stage saved the day
